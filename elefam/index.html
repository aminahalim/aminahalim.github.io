            <div class="paragraph1">
                ELEFAM is a care-collaboration platform that we designed specifically for people caring for a loved-one suffering from dementia. We pitched this project at the Hack the City competition in 2018, where we won $6000 for being one of the finalists.            </div>

                Dementia causes a decline in memory and other thinking skills, which significantly reduces one’s ability to perform everyday activities. Examples of such activities include preparing meals, taking medications, keeping track of personal belongings, and navigating home. People suffering from dementia are often taken care of by their families.            </div>

            <div class="paragraph1">
                A large number of families caring for a loved-one with dementia reported that these caregiving responsibilities have taken a toll on their own health and well-being. The main caregiver is usually a working professional who is in the “sandwich generation”, which means they have elderly parents as well as children of their own. In fact, 40% of these family caregivers suffer from depression.            </div>

                According to The Alzheimer's Society of Canada, there are 6.3 million people living with dementia in North America. Our target users will be those caring for a loved one with dementia who lives outside of a nursing home. Therefore, we have a total market size of 4.7 million North Americans.     </div>

            <div class="paragraph1">
                We attended local dementia caregiving workshops and passed out surveys for our primary market research. Out of the 78 responses we received, 58% of the family caregiviers expressed that they would be willing to pay $10-25 per month for our product. Therefore, we would have an annual market size of $987 million.    </div>

                The Alzheimer’s Society of Hamilton helped us connect with local family caregivers. We interviewed these families in order to further understand the challenges and stresses that arise from caring for a loved-one with dementia. Presented on the left is Belinda’s story.            </div>

            <div class="paragraph1">
                From our interactions with our target users, we learned that conflicts arise from poor communication amongst family members and from a lack of an adequate care plan involving everyone.            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph2">
                We translated the key issues dementia caregivers are currently facing into product features. ELEFAM's MVP will need to have task sharing, calendar, and chat features for care collaboration amongst family members. A medication schedule and medical history tab will help caregivers note health problems that come from dementia and old age. Many caregivers have mentioned their loved one with dementia's tendency to wander off on their own. Therefore, we also included a wearable device with a location tracker and QR Emergency code to help them locate their loved one. </div>

                During our prototyping phase, we received the following feedback.                <br><br>
                <b> POSITIVES</b>
                <br>
                - Caregivers really liked the task-sharing concept                <br>
                - Caregivers validated their need for a platform where they can keep all notes and information dedicated to their family member suffering from dementia
                <br><br>
                <b> NEGATIVES </b>
                <br>
                - Our product is not specifically designed for dementia caregivers
                <br>
                - Lacking a unique selling point
                <br>
                - Not easy enough to integrate into their current care plans

                RE-DESIGNING
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph1">
                Studies have shown that people suffering from dementia benefit immensely from a structured daily routine. Establishing a daily routine provides them with the comforting sense of familiarity and predictability. This will help decrease their distraction and forgetfulness as well as improve their mood.
                <br><br>
                The new design of the app would focus on helping families build and stick to a daily routine for their loved one. The family members would then divide up the daily care responsibilities amongst one another.            </div>
