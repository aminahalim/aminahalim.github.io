            <div class="paragraph1">
                Winic is one of my passion projects I started in order to tackle the issue of long wait times at Canadian walk-in clinics. I conducted primary and secondary market research, collected qualitative and quantitative data, brainstormed ideas with potential stakeholders, and created wireframes and users flows before arriving at my final prototype.

               <br> PROBLEM
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph2">
                In 2017, over half the Canadian population had reported that their most common reason for skipping doctors visits is due to long wait times. Waiting to see a doctor while you are congested and feverish is not the most comfortable activity, especially when all you want to do is recover ASAP and get back to your regular routine.            </div>

            <div class="paragraph1">
                After learning the overview of this country-wide problem, we narrowed our research to focus on the clinics in our city. This table presents recent patient reviews for three clinics in the Hamilton Region.        </div>

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph2">
                The following methods were used for our primary market research:
                <br> → Online Surveys for clinic owners and patients (quantitative research)
                <br> → Face-to-face stakeholder interviews (qualitative research)
                <br><br>
                <b>Quantitative Results from Patients:</b> <br>
                - None of our respondents use an online tool to book an appointment <br>
                - 72% of our respondents usually spend 1+ hours in the waiting room <br>
                - 60% of respondents are unaware about wait times <br>
                <br>
                <b>Qualitative Results from Patients:</b> <br>
                We asked patients if they are satisfied with their current experiences at clinics. Almost all of the dissatisfied respondents' main complaint is the long amount of time spent in the waiting room.

            The user will be able to search for a nearby clinic using either the list view or map view. The will be able view the clinic wait times, distance, and reviews. After they have selected their clinic, they will be given an estimated wait time and will be able to monitor their place in line. Winic will remind them when it is almost their time to leave their house.

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph2">
                I designed the user interface on Sketch and brought the screens to life on InVision. The goal was to create a simple three-step process for patients to be able to remotely add themselves to the waiting list at walk-in clinics. Initially, the clinics would have iPads where patients who are walking in would sign up and add themselves in queue. Eventually, the goal is for all patients to remotely check in on their own devices, so the amount of patients in walk-in clinic waiting rooms would significantly decrease. This will ultimately lead to an increase in patient satisfaction and healthier Canadians!
