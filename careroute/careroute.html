            <div class="paragraph1">
                CareRoute has identified two significant problems in the North American caregiving industry: 1) Seniors needing special care are usually cared for by their family members. These families experience stress and difficulty juggling their care responsibilties with their personal and professional lives. 2) Personal Support Workers are struggling to find new clients.

                Advancements in medicine and quality of life has caused a rapid increase in the aging population throughout the past few decades. In addition to a longer life span, these seniors also have a greater desire to remain independent and reside in their own homes. As the Baby Boomer generation nears the 65+ age range, the senior respite care industry will only continue to grow.

            <div class="paragraph1">
                CareRoute is an online-to-offline mobile app that would help unpaid family caregivers arrange personal support workers in a quick and simple way. Through our mobile app, family caregivers can request for in-home respite care services from local personal support workers.

                Our innovative solution would help bridge the gaps in the caregiving industry. By allowing family caregivers to effectively share their careload with personal support workers, families will be less stressed and overwhelmed and PSWs will have new job opportunities.

            <div class="paragraph1">
                According to the National Center on Caregiving, the aging respite care market is worth $4.4 billion. This market is divided into two segments: 1) the in-home respite care and 2) long-term care homes. We will only be targeting the former segment, which takes up 80% of the aging respite care market and therefore has a market size $3.5 billion. 50% 0f the home care market requires long term care, so we have ended up with a market size of $1.7 billion.

                Two main revenue streams:
                <br>
                1) Respite Care Services: Family caregivers pay $25 per service hour. CareRoute keeps 20%. PSW will be paid $20 per service hour. 
                <br>
                2) PSW Annual Membership Fee: PSWs will be charged $40 per year to use our platform

            We concluded on the following product architeure plan. We will be developing two different smartphone applications: one for family caregivers and another for PSWs. Our admin portal will monitor the data that is entered by our users, manage their requests, and control the access to both apps. The portion of the diagram that is shaded blue represents the backend.

                PROOF OF CONCEPT

            <div class="paragraph2">
                In order to prove our concept, we had to assess both the technical feasibility and commercial viability.
                <br><br>
                <b> TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY</b>
                <br>
                The video shows a demo for the two high-fidelity prototypes I built for family caregivers and personal support workers. I collected user feedback from interested families and PSWs across the Greater Toronto Area throughout the entire design process in order to ensure our product would effectively meet all their needs. 
                <br><br>
                <b> COMMERCIAL VIABILITY </b>
                <br>
                We were able to connect with several families and PSWs who expressed their interest in our product and service and agreed to participate in our simulation. Families allowed us arrange PSWs to visit their homes and provide their services. With sucessful simulations, we were able to earn our first profits and validate our business model.
