                COVID-19 has shocked the world and caught most countries unprepared and extremely overwhelmed with trying to protect the health of their populations. However, amid all the confusion and the fear, the power of individuals, organizations, and communities to think differently and to innovate shows what can be achieved when people are united by common, clear priorities and necessity.            </div>

                One of my neighbors came by my house a couple of weeks ago with homemade masks that she was distributing around our neighborhood. I started thinking about how quiet and disconnected our entire neighborhood had suddenly become. We have no knowledge about what our neighbors are going through during this time. Are they doing okay? Do they need any assistance? I left this conversation with my neighbor feeling inspired to start a new project.            </div>
