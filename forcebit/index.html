            <div class="fbparagraph1">
                Our universityâ€™s biotech department holds an annual competition where students are challenged to come up with an innovative new product idea that tackles an existing health-related problem. My teammates and I took home first prize for our technical and business plan for a concussion-screening device designed for recreational and professional athletes.

                PROBLEM
            </div>
            <div class="fbparagraph1">
                Concussion related injuries account for over 275,000 hospitalizations every year. Concussion is a serious concern for athletes. 2 in 10 athletes suffer from concussions every year. Signs of concussion are often ignored, as there is no singular method to detect concussions in real time. 47% of all athletes feel no symptoms after a high-impact hit, causing them to neglect to report their injury to their medical personnel. When a concussion is left undiagnosed, it leads to increased chances of loss of consciousness in future concussions.

                ForceBit: A mouthguard that will assess the impact of force and acceleration on the head while athletes are playing on the field and transmit this data to a smartphone app where it can be monitored by concerned family members and coaches. This sports accessory is to be used in conjunction with existing screening procedures to detect possible concussions.

                    After our competition ended, I decided to finish off this project by designing our software product. I used proto.io to build this high-fidelity interactive prototype for our ForceBit mobile app. This demo video shows the steps the coach or family member take to easily monitor the athletes head injuries through a few simple screens.
